### What is this?
La Capitaine is an icon pack, designed to integrate with most desktop environments. The set of icons takes inspiration from the latest iterations of Mac OS X and Google's Material Design.

Every image in this theme is a _scalable vector graphic_ so it will look great at any size, on any screen. In my spare time, I work on adding new icons, updating old ones, and making this theme more complete. Since this theme is updated often, you should clone this git repository and pull regularly to make sure you're always up-to-date:

    cd ~/.icons
    git clone https://github.com/keeferrourke/la-capitaine-icon-theme

### Configuration
La Capitaine comes with a configuration script which attempts to determine your distribution and desktop environment. Using this information, La Capitaine updates several system icons and icons used for mime-types.

For best integration with your distro/desktop environment, please run `./configure` and follow the prompts.

### Recommendations
La Capitaine looks best with a theme based on either Material Design or Mac OS X. Though I don't make GTK+ themes, some of my favourites are: [Flat-Plat](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Flat-Plat?content=167704), [Adapta](https://github.com/tista500/Adapta), [Paper](https://snwh.org/paper/theme), [Arc](https://github.com/horst3180/arc-theme), and [Arc-OSX](http://gnome-look.org/content/show.php/Arc-OSX-themes?content=175536). Have fun, and happy theming!

### Icon Requests

If there's an icon that's missing in this project, feel free to [contact me](https://krourke.org/contact). Please provide me with the name of the application (and/or the name of the icon), the context of the icon (status, app, etc.), and in the case of desktop applications, a copy of the desktop file located at `/usr/share/applications/yourapplication.desktop` or `~/.local/share/applications/yourapplication.desktop`

If you find that an application icon is not themed, but an icon appears in this project with the wrong (or a different) file name as specified in your x-desktop file, please let me know or open an issue.

### Roadmap
To-do:
 * Introduce more icon geometry; the mostly circular base is boring
 * Introduce subtler, softer gradients, lighting, and shadows
 * Change software store and management icons to something more original/generic
